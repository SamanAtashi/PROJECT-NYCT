					<p>
						CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
						physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
						at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
						venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
						particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
						discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
						potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
						have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
						repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
						of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>
					<p>
						If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
						heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
						mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
						irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
						diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
						and drew a double box around it.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
						that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
						hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

						Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
						cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
						led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
						Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
						so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
						wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
						trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
						smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
						colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
						many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<p>
						If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
						science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
						the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
						realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
						14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
						galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
						extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
						own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
						bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
						over.
					</p>
				</article>

					<h4>‘As Big as It Gets’</h4>
					<p>
						In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
						operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
						accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
						Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
						gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
						general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
						expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as
						it gets.”
					</p>
					<p>
						He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
						sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
						of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
						of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
						surface of the sun.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
						Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
						reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
						Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
						Astrophysical Journal.

					<p>
						Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
						in 10 million.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
						not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
					</p>
					<p>
						“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
						been lucky.”
					</p>
					<p>
						The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
						worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
						leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
						few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
						Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that
						night in 1979), in his office last week.
					</p>
					<p>
						“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
						scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
						tended his radio telescopes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
						the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
						in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
						Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
						knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
					</p>
					<p>
						Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
						ordered anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was
						a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
						simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
						wrote in an email.
					</p>
					<p>
						By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
						inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
						with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
					</p>
					<p>
						Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
						that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
						discoveries in the history of science.”
					</p>
					<p>
						John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
						and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
						pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
						beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
						that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
						genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
						model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
						need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
						estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
						European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
						the universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
						Krauss said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
						will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
						are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
						space.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Spirals in the Sky</h4>
					<p>
						Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
						cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
						Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the
						Nobel Prize.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
						waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
						series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
						where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The
						others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock
						of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
					</p>
					<p>
						“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
						the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
						wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
					</p>

				<article>
					<p>
						In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
						radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
						preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
						gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in
						one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
						twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists
						said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
						little arrows going in spirals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
						differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
						telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
					</p>
					<p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
					<p>
						The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent
						a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they
						had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to
						the breakthrough.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>A Special Time</h4>
					<p>
						The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
						like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
						suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
						universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
						gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But
						they have long suspected that those are simply different
						manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in
						its earliest, hottest moments.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
						from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling
						out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
						after another splitting away.
					</p>
					<p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
					<p>
						Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
						temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
						point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
						state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with
						a mysterious latent energy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a
						kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it
						was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
						created, the harder it pushed apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
						least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
						primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
						cosmic eye-blink.
					</p>
					<p>
						Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
						particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still
						ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
						stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is
						no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
						universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
						from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
						started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
						comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
						blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as
						the multiverse.
					</p>
					<p>
						So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
						bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
					</p>
					<p>
						We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
						beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
						All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
						away, forever out of our view.
					</p>
					<p>
						“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
						Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
						wind up at inflation.”
